someone are intrested in working at companies like amazon,microsoft,and so on
but There are someone who want to work for themselves

in my view if You who are gonna be a successful developer  
you should gain experience first because if you are gonna found a start up you must have enough experience in your field
otherwise you wlii fail at first moment and i advise you to work at a good and successful company and gain experience
and then found your own start up and business you are intrested in

this was a short advice from me and i hope you to enjoy it 

good luck
